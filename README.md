### 1. Description  

**What is this project?**  

*  Simple application for cat lovers to review the 60+ breeds known in the world.  
   
   [Live application:  kitty-wiki.herokuapp.com]

**Why this project?**  

* I did this app as part of a job application - I didn't get the job - but I like the app I did.  So I'm keeping the app alive and I've refactored it to work as a Lambda serverless app so I can host it on Netlify.  All this because Heroku gave up providing free distos to the developer community on 26-Oct-2022.

### 2. User Story  

* AS a domestic cat lover and possibly interested in adding to my domestic cat family  
* I WANT to have a place to search all the known cat breeds in the world  
* SO THAT I can get more information on the different breeds.  


### 3. Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a landing page dedicated to domestic cat breeds  
* WHEN I search for cat breeds from the homepage and select a breed of my choice from the list  
* THEN I am taken to a new page that provides details specific to the breed I selected  
* WHEN seeing the page about the cat breed I selected I see more photos of the breed
* AND I see the breed details including description, temperament, origin, life span, adaptability, affection level, child-friendly, grooming, intelligence, health issues, social needs, stranger friendly.
